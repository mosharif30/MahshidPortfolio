      I was born on a hot summer day in Rasht which is called the city of rain.
      That is why I love rain and the smell of rain-soaked soil. The people of
      Rasht have an interesting custom: When a baby's first tooth comes out,
      they place some tools in front of her and they believe that whatever she
      picks up will become the main tool of her career in the future. As
      evidenced by a photo, by picking up a pink marker, I chose my part in the
      world from childhood. I became an illustrator and graphic designer to
      share my world with children and sometimes adults. In 2001, I was accepted
      into the graphic design department at the Art & architectural Azad
      University and from the very beginning I realized that I loved my field of
      study that became my path of my life and my way of seeing and exploring.
      In 2006, I was accepted into the master's degree and continued my studies.
      Despite the fact that I would work over all the years of study and had
      mastered various software, after finishing university, I gradually felt
      that manual work is more attractive to me than the digital world. My
      passion for drawing increased Little by little. I took my habit of
      scribbling on paper more seriously, improved it and gradually entered the
      world of illustration; a world in which I find my lost past, and I picture
      a colorful future. And this is how I became both a graphic designer and an
      illustrator. Both paths help me follow my dreams; the dreams full of
      light, color and image. In the city where I grew up, I always saw trees
      and colorful fruits everywhere I looked. The sky was blue and each cloud
      had its own story. I used to wake up with the rooster`s crowing and the
      crickets chirp was my lullaby. I'm still looking for the woodpecker that
      knocks on the tree next to our house. I do not fantasize, I illustrate
      everything that I have actually seen.
